# FKUSRepo

This GitHub repository contains MATLAB scripts and functions to assist in calculations involving orbital mechanics including reference frame conversions, iterative processes and the obtainability of orbital elements given state vectors. Python files are slowly being added which replicate calculations seen in the MATLAB files but are used to animate the orbit of a spacecraft.
